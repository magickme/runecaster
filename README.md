### General Info

This is a simple program to throw a three-rune spread based on a question. You'll need to hold the question sincerely in your heart before you run the program in Node. 

Despite the simplicity of the program, the runes are given with esoteric information drawn from the work of Stephen Flowers. This simple program can as such be used to great success for personal education, and its efficacy in divination has been most assured. We have used the Elder Futhark runes in this program.

### Tech Used

+ Vanilla JS
+ Node.js

### Setup

You will need Node.js installed on your machine.

Navigate to the folder that contains Runecaster.js. Ask a question sincerelyâ€”it is often best to ask the runes to "shed light" onto a general situation in your life. Then input into the command line:

```
node runecaster.js
```

That's it!

### Status

This app has been completed, unless I decide to come back and work on it for more JS practice.
